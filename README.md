# Standards
This is a guideline repository for my account that details numerous aspects of code projects to ensure all my other repositories are clean and consistent.

**Coding conventions**, also called **code style guides**, **programming guidelines**, or **code standards**, among other names, are a set of guidelines written for a specific programming language that recommend certain programming style, practices and methods for different aspects of that language.

They help to keep software consistent between developers, which allows for easier collaboration and long-term maintenance. They are not enforced by the program's compiler(s), but they are advantageous to use rather than ignore.

Other coding conventions include Google's [styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) and Python's [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

## Usage
You can read the [source files](https://github.com/thatgaypigeon/standards/tree/main), separated by language and topic, or you can browse [the wiki](https://github.com/thatgaypigeon/standards/wiki/) which provides a more general overview of the guidelines, but still indicates language-specific conventions.
