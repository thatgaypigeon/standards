# Links
Linking should follow the standard syntax of `[Title](url)`.

It should look like this: [Link](https://example.com)

Most of the time, you should include both the site name and the page title in the text portion of the link markup: `[Website: Page](url)`.

It should look like this: [Website: Page](https://example.com).

## Subpages / topics
Subpage or inner links should include the main and subpage titles in the display text, separated by a right-pointing arrow and a non-breaking space on the right: `[Page → Subpage](url)`.

This uses the Unicode characters **U+2191** (`→`) "Rightwards Arrow" and **U+00A0** (` `) "Non-Breaking Space".

It should look like this: [Page → Subpage](https://example.com).

## Sections
Section links should include the section title in the display text, separated by a section sign and a non-breaking space on the right: `[Page § Section](url#section)`.

This uses the Unicode characters **U+00A7** (`§`) "Section Sign" and **U+00A0** (` `) "Non-Breaking Space".

It should look like this: [Page § Section](https://example.com#section).

## Full markup
The full link markup is: `\[[Website: ]Page[ → Subpage][ § Section]\](URL[#SectionURL])`.
