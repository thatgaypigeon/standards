# Hatnotes
**Hatnotes**, also called **headnotes** are short notices placed at the top of a page or section. They serve a variety of purposes, such as disambiguation, clarification, redirection, or other important information such as a date or title notice.

While generally used within the Wikimedia community by editors, they can be useful in other contexts, such as this. As this is not a Wikimedia-powered site, there are not auto-generating templates, and any hatnotes need to be typed manually. However, below are some common hatnotes that can be copy-pasted.
